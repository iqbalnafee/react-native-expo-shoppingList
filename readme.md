# Next, we need to add react-test-renderer to our project:
2. npm i react-test-renderer --save-dev 

# if previous command need lates npm versions just run the following commands
1. npm install -g npm-check-updates
2. ncu -u
3. npm install

# if the new npm vesions are not compitable with expo then just run to rollback to previous vesion
1. expo doctor --fix-dependencies

# if react-test-render is not compitable the current version of react then simply run: npm i react-test-renderer --force --save-dev

# CI CD end
